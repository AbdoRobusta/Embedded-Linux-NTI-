Qt Project Security Policy
==========================

The Qt Project specifies its security policy in [QUIP 15](https://contribute.qt-project.org/quips/15). A summary of the security policy:

* Qt has a Core Security Team that enforces the security policy and addresses issues.
* Proactive measures to prevent security issues - code reviews, code analysis, fuzz testing, and so on.
* Reporting Security Issues: the Core Security Team monitors security issues for Qt modules and affected third-party components.
* Handling Security Issues: the maintainers, Core Security Team, Chief Maintainer, and the Qt Company share and handle security issues.
* Disclosure of confirmed security issues at Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database and a public announcement to the Qt announce@qt-project.org mailing list.

Reporting Security Issues
-------------------------

To report security issues in Qt Products, send an email to Security Mail List at security@qt-project.org.
The Core Security Team monitors and moderates incoming emails on business days (excluding weekends).
After sending an email to the Security Mail List, there will be an acknowledgment of receipt within
two business days. If there is no response, then the reporter should contact the Chief Maintainer directly.

What Versions of Qt are Covered by this Policy?
-----------------------------------------------

While we are interested in reports against any Qt version that is still maintained, fixes are only guaranteed to be provided for:

* The latest released version.
* The preceding minor version.
